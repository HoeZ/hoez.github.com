**OSS TERM PROJECT : OTHELLO GAME**
===================


The theme of this project is to build a game based on the lessons learned during this semester. In this project I implemented **Othello** game in **C** language.

Game Introduction
-------------

Othello is a kind of board game. Also called **Reversi**. Two people stand on the Othello plate of eight columns and eight turns, alternating black and white stones.

It was invented in 1880 by two English names, Lewis Waterman and James Mollet, in the name of Reversi. Ravensburger of Germany, famous for its game developer, made its debut in 1898. In 1970, Hasegawa Goro revised the Reversi in Japan under the name "Othello" and spread it around the world.

The name was selected by Hasegawa as a reference to the Shakespearean play Othello, the Moor of Venice, referring to the conflict between the Moor Othello and Iago, and more controversially, to the unfolding drama between Othello, who is black, and Desdemona, who is white. The green color of the board is inspired by the image of the general Othello, valiantly leading his battle in a green field. It can also be likened to a jealousy competition (jealousy being the central theme in Shakespeare's play), since players engulf the pieces of the opponent, thereby turning them to their possession.


Game Tutorial

> **RULES:**

> - Initially, you start with four stones placed squarely in the middle of the plate.
> - The stone must surround the opponent's stone on both sides and place it in a reversible place.
 > - If there is no place to turn the stone, the turn will automatically be passed on to the opponent.
 > - The game ends when both sides can no longer place stones under the following conditions.
 >> - If all 64 stones are full of plates (most common).
 >> - If either side reverses the stone.
 >> - If both sides need to pass each other's turn.

> - At the end of the game, the player with lots of stones becomes the **winner**. If the number of stones is the same, it is a draw.
